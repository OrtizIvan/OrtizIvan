                    <h2>Water shortage</h2>
                    <p>
                        Without water there is no life. Water shortages are therefore one of the most threatening developments that can lead societies to and from collapse.
                         Water shortages can be caused either by natural factors (possibly exacerbated by human actions), mostly climate-related factors, and can lead to droughts and the death of ecosystems. Today, we cannot influence these large-scale climatic developments any more than Mayans or Anasazi could.
This section is therefore primarily about water waste and the end of water availability in some regions of the world. While in countries such as Iran, Yemen or the southwest of the USA there is a risk that the supply of drinking water will disappear in the coming decades, Germany has extensive groundwater reservoirs that are re-forming at a sufficient speed. Due to the high evaporation rate in summer, however, this development takes place almost exclusively between October and April. 
For these reasons, a water shortage, which, as in 2018 and 2020,occurs in the main growth phase between March and May, can no longer be compensated for in the rest of the year in this country.
 If, as in Brandenburg or some areas in Thuringia, a fundamental tendency to dry phases due to continental climate and sandy soils is added, the risk of droughts and forest and moor fires in summer, as well as crop failures, increases.
However, the forest areas that depend on regular rain are particularly vulnerable. While the situation in Germany still leaves room for optimism, this seems inappropriate in regions where drinking water is obtained almost exclusively from fossil water sources. Most of the water is used for agriculture. At the same time, the so-called water stress continues torise in many countries. 
However, especially countries that suffer particularly from water shortages have a very high per capita consumption,which can be explained at least in part by high evaporation rates and inefficient irrigation systems. At the same time, some of these countries are also unable to efficiently purify dirty and grey water and make it available to the water cycle again. In addition, in countries that rely heavily on the agricultural sector, there is the problem of so-called virtual water imports.
 This means that drinking water from water-scarce regions is exported as an agricultural product to other countries that do not suffer from the same water shortage. 
All these factors are already making themselves felt in the form of high food prices, refugee movements and disappearing ecosystems.

                    <h2>Water pollution
                    </h2>
                    <p>
                        Water pollution is one of the most serious environmental problems. It is true that the state of surface waters in Germany and many other Western bodies has improved significantly since the 1980s.
                         Self-igniting rivers and mass dying events have become rare in these countries due to strict regulations, better filters and modern sewage treatment plants.
                          Exposure to persistent substances and heavy metals has also fallen sharply. As a result of these measures and European directives such as the WFD, water quality has increased in recent years. But even in this country, the devil is in the detail. Pesticide, nitrate and drug residues are still found in far too high quantities in water bodies. 
                        Other, more modern compounds such as per- and polyfluorinated alkyl compounds (so-called PFAS),better known as Teflon, are not degradable naturally, but at the same time bioaccumulative and persistent. Micro- and nanoplastic particles also remain in the environment forever if they are not extensively cleaned. The removal of these substances, as well as pharmaceuticals from the environment, is also difficult with our technical possibilities. Even the new treatment stage IV in sewage treatment plants should not be able to filter all substances from the wastewater. And groundwater quality has even deterioratedfrequently in recent years.
In coastal areas of many countries, as well as in salt-rich inland regions, there is also an increasing salinization caused by falling groundwater levels. In most developing countries, however, faecalpollution, as well as inputs from industrial processes, mining activities and agricultural cultivation methods, are the main input pathways. Another not negligible factor is the pollution with plastic, which would be relatively easy to remedy by efficient recycling plants. However, money alone does not help to solve these problems. Rather, it would be necessary through education and technology transfer to empower these countries to solve their problems on their own. This would also help us. For example, more than 50% of the plastic waste in the oceans comes from five Asian countries, while according to other studies, 90% comes from Asia and Africa.

                    <h2>Extreme weather events</h2>
                    <p>
                        Extreme weather events and water are like Janus-headed siblings.
                         Either too much (floods, hurricanes, heavy rain and monsoon, storm surges, heavy snowfall) or too little (fire, heat, drought and drought) of water occurs. 
                         In general, there is a connection to wind systems, which sometimes occur on a large scale, but often only locally. 
                         Since all extreme weather events are climate-related, the question arises as to whether, and if so, what influence does climate change have on the frequency and intensity of these events? Here the views differ due to a lack of data. At the moment, the majority of climate researchers consider it likely that extreme weather events will increase in intensity, but not in frequency. 
                         Factors mentioned here are that warmer temperatures also lead to higher temperatures in the sea, which means that more water evaporates and can collect in the form of clouds. At the same time, more water evaporates on land, with the result that more stable weather situations are created. However, it should not be forgotten that certain complex cycles are still not sufficiently understood. T
                        hese primarily include global wind systems such as the Passat and the Monsoon, which interact with ocean currents such as the Humbold Current or the Gulf Stream. These, in turn, are again dependent on temperature differences, as well as differences in the salinity of the sea, factors influenced by the poles and the melting of poleis. Modeling these different factors is impossible even today. 
                        At the same time, however, there are also developments that are already making themselves felt and contributing to extreme weather events:
                        drier and hotter summers, as well as a drier spring with an earlier vegetation phase, isolated, more intense heavy rainfall events, stronger storms and a melting of glaciers. Drought phases also seem to be increasing, which increases the risk of forest fires and crop failures, e.B. However, one should be careful not to blame any extreme weather event solely on climate change. 
                        For example, the forest fires in Australia, the USA and also in Brandenburg in recent years probably developed from a combination of, paradoxically, previously absent fire events, incorrect vegetation and disregard of rules of conduct. 
                        These effects exacerbated the problems exacerbated by climate change, such as higher temperatures and intense drought caused by the El Nino effect in the southern hemisphere. An interplay of direct and indirect human intervention is also contributing to developments in Europe that produce similarly drastic results in extreme weather events. 
                        One example is flooding, which is exacerbated by the straightening of rivers and the construction of settlements in floodplain areas. This problem has been recognized in recent decades and countermeasures have also been initiated. Nevertheless, it remains a problem that cannot be easily turned back everywhere.
