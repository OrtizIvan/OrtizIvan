            <h2>No universal solutions </h2>
            <p>
                No matter what problem we look at - there are seldom solutions that work always and everywhere!
                Photovoltaics can become an important energy source for Africa, Spain or Australia, but in
                Central and Northern Europe will only ever make a relatively small contribution to the energy mix.
                Excessive cycle paths are less useful in regions with a lot of snow or very hot temperatures
                than in Central Europe or North America.
                In addition to these climate-related factors, the question then arises as to which solutions make sense
                are? In my experience, people are reluctant to give up habits, which is why
                Coercive measures are perceived very negatively. Human action is always in the future
                directed. The aim should therefore be to find solutions that do not see the loss as a loss but as a
                a gain in quality of life can be felt.
                An example of this would be cities that are architecturally liveable on the one hand and are included on the other
                function as organically as possible. But whoever regards the driver as an enemy makes himself a
                Urban planners make life difficult for themselves. A car-free city center is perceived as pleasant, by car
                Don't get near this as dismissive.
                Which approaches are promising does not only depend on how positive a measure is for
                the environment is, but how it is accepted by the population.
                <br> Many factors contribute to success, starting with the planning process, the ability to
                Participation, economic considerations and technical feasibility.
                The changes in our world are happening faster and faster, research is happening everywhere.
                Digitization has captured all areas of our work.
                <br> I would like to talk about some of them in the following sections, some appear
                maybe too technical or are still too expensive. Many technologies that are still expensive today, such as
                However, battery storage or low-energy houses could become cheaper as soon as they become mass market
                are suitable. For others it will only be possible through state funding.
                We can all use completely different methods such as rooftop or social gardening without great expense
                to be integrated today. The biggest factor in developing sustainable solutions, however, are
                Companies. They recognized the trend towards assessing sustainability risks years ago,
                so that a market has emerged in the area of ​​"environmental, social and governance (ESG)" that of Forbes

            <h2>Wandern in der Stadt</h2>
            <p>
                What should the city look like today? What makes them worth living in and how can they be diverse
                 Requirements for their functionality are efficiently implemented? A city cannot afford it
                 Wasting resources. Neither in people, nor in money or raw materials. The subject is urban planning
                 extremely complex, requires a lot of tact and sensitivity due to its socio-ecological explosive power
                 Concepts that should be as universally applicable as possible.
                 At the same time, however, the niches that result from the abundance of different areas should also be preserved
                 Ways of life. As an avid pedestrian, I saw one a few years ago  <a
                    href="https://www.ted.com/talks/jeff_speck_4_ways_to_make_a_city_more_walkable?language=en">Ted
                    Talk</a> von <a href="https://www.jeffspeck.com/">Jeff Speck</a>, Harvard Professor and Author of the
                    Book "Walkable City" and saw almost everything united in this concept that we think of a city
                    wish:
                    Autonomous districts with shops, cafes, lively squares that invite you to linger, few
                    Cars, preferably a beach and an overarching concept that doesn't forget that the
                    City is made up of different body parts, all of which are required. Building on that, I started to
                    consider what makes a city worth living in? Many parks? An exciting nightlife?
                    Shopping? Workplaces and sports facilities that are easily accessible by bike
                    are? No cars, but excellent local public transport?
                    Space for creative minds, artists and idlers who enjoy sitting in their little house and the
                    To maintain the garden? All of this is expensive and rarely brings a high return in the form of taxes. Jeff
                    Speck therefore recommends concentrating primarily on certain districts, which are very
                    are popular and from which a signal effect can emanate to be developed in the best possible way. In most
                    In some cases, these are the inner cities, followed by areas that are attractive to tourists.
                    In a next step, these should then be connected to other parts of the city with pedestrian and bicycle paths
                    get connected. However, this does not mean that other neighborhoods are completely neglected. here
                    Design regulations could help to create a uniform cityscape that you can linger on
                    invites and saves resources. I consider this approach to be expedient for all cities worldwide. To that
                    There are many ideas for improving the urban climate that make a city green. That doesn't just see
                    nice, but also filters the air from fine dust and exhaust gases and even reduces stress and <a
                    href="https://www.spektrum.de/news/wie-das-leben-in-der-stadt-die-psyche-belastet/1718998">mental
                    Diseases </a>. Urban gardening has been known here for decades in Mexico City
                    Elevated streets clad with walls made of plants that help filter the air.
                    The idea of rooftop gardening was first introduced in Babylon more than 3000 years ago
                    applied. In cities like Andernach became communal <a
                    href="https://www.andernach.de/de/leben_in_andernach/essbare_stadt.html">Vegetable gardens </a> created.
                    Biodiversity can be created by breaking the sealing of land, and citizens too
                    Encourages native plants to settle in their gardens and sow meadows instead of lawns. Pure
                    Rock gardens are suitable for deserts, but stone walls and hedges can also help in temperate zones
                    To provide a home for lizards and insects. These ideas not only ensure a better urban climate,
                    but can also help to strengthen social cohesion in a city.

                Energy generation, energy use and the energy transition. If you want to discuss these topics, enter
                Minefield. Many actors from different areas have opinions on this and appear every year
                countless reports. Meanwhile even has <a
                    href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zk11vI-7czE">Michael Moore</a> of the topic accepted. why
                    is that so? Different interests, lots and lots of money, fears and
                    Effects on nature that all technologies that produce energy have. Energy generation without
                    Side effects do not exist.
                    In addition, there is the nimby (not in my backyard) effect with wind turbines and new lines, because itself
                    People who have a positive view of renewable energies often do not want them in theirs
                    Have neighborhood. But we need energy  <a
                    href="https://www.iea.org/reports/world-energy-outlook-2019"> more and more </a>. The topic
                    Energy cannot be briefly addressed and the transformation process is in full swing,
                    not only in Europe. Therefore, only individual aspects should be picked out here briefly.
                    Europe's strength is diversity. This is particularly evident in the question of
                    Energy production. France relies on nuclear power,
                    Germany on wind and solar, Scandinavia, Switzerland and Austria on hydropower, Spain on
                    Solar and most other countries use a mix of different forms of energy. This system offers
                    correspondingly many niches to test technologies. In my view, this diversity should apply to everyone
                    Case persists and countries within the EU are not forced to submit.
                    The radical course in Germany is not necessarily target-oriented, because it is still going with the
                    The aim is to be self-sufficient when it comes to energy issues. The possibilities for energy generation are in
                    Germany limited. Solar cells make sense as part of the mix, but the natural occurrences
                    are much less suitable for this in Germany than in countries like Spain or North Africa.
                    Production with on-shore wind turbines
                    actually leads to significantly higher death rates of <a 
                    href="https://www.nabu.de/tiere-und-pflanzen/saeugetiere/fledermaeuse/wissen/15018.html">Bats </a>
                and also represents a burden for previously intact  <a
                    href="https://www.hna.de/lokales/hofgeismar/trendelburg-ort43206/reinhardswald-start-windkraftverfahren-12902168.html">Wooded areas </a>
                    Similar problems arise, for example, in countries in the Balkans that, funded by
                    in the last unobstructed streams  <a
                    href="https://bizz-energy.com/wasserkraft_boom_suedosteuropa_mit_nebenwirkungen">build </a>.This is
                    no nature conservation, because such measures endanger entire ecosystems. There would be
                    enough other options. The most important one is the cross-border one already mentioned
                    Connectivity of modern high-performance electricity networks. In our contemporary, modern, times shouldn't
                    more every country can generate its own electricity completely.
                    Instead, the ecologically least useful areas should be identified and used.
                    Another option is research. However, this does not solve our short-term problems that are im
                    There is a connection with climate change and the use of fossil fuels.
                    As the central energy source for the period after 2050, Europe is hoping for nuclear fusion and is building on
                    ITER research reactor. Even if it is more than uncertain whether this will be the case in the medium-term future
                    If a usable energy source is created, this research should be carried out as a basis. in the
                    There are different areas of nuclear energy
                    modern research approaches that address many of the previous problems (uranium-235 use, meltdown, need for
                    Repositories) could fix. Due to traditional positions and the negative experiences with
                    However, first and second generation technologies (Chernobyl, Fukushima) still have nuclear power
                    a very bad reputation. As seen, however, even sustainable energy sources have partially
                    serious side effects and are with <a 
                    href="https://www.bundesregierung.de/breg-de/themen/energiewende/was-bringt-was-kostet-die-energiewende-394146">high
                    costs  </a> tied together. 
                    From my point of view, there is another problem: we will not be able to get through climate change
                    To stop renunciation because voluntary renunciation is against human nature. Should this be
                    are true, we are left with technologies such as Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) as the only option
                    have an extremely high energy requirement themselves and therefore currently still cause absurdly high costs
                    (Saving a ton of CO <sub> 2 </sub> up to $ 600).
                    In order to be prepared for this, all possible technologies are necessary. This is one of the
                    The main reasons why, for environmental and climate protection reasons, I decided to continue researching <a 
                    href="https://whatisnuclear.com/thorium.html">Thorium-, Molten-Salt</a> und <a 
                    href="https://dual-fluid-reaktor.de/technical/">Strongly advocate dual fluid </a> reactors. Alongside
                    could also previously highly radioactive nuclear fuel rods recycled and into radioactive substances with a
                    relatively short half-life and thus the repository problem can be solved.
                    The global engineering methods that are also being considered have compared to the storage or even the
                    recycling greenhouse gases has a major disadvantage: They don't solve the problem, because they always have to
                    reapplied and the problem will recur immediately if they are discontinued. It's like
                    if you have a chronic disease such as high blood pressure or diabetes.
                    Regardless of which technologies should prevail in this area: The development
                    of storage for electricity can be extremely helpful, because all energy sources have this in common:
                    There is always energy left that is wasted. There are large-scale power plants here

            <h2>Consumption and Exercise </h2>
            <p>
                <h3>Transport</h3>
                The transport sector is in motion like hardly any other area of our life. Also in the one after Corona
                 We want to travel and consume time, have to come to work and relax in the countryside
                 we energy. Where this should come from and what type of drive should fuel it is EUR 1 trillion
                 Question. The future of any form of transport depends on the type of drive. This was and is one
                 the
                 greatest advantage of crude oil, as it can be used in all modes of transport with almost no problems. It
                 it is unlikely that we will be able to find a form of energy again which, on the one hand, is so complete,
                 on the other hand, it is also so easily usable and available in large reserves. Despite being diverse
                 Attempts to establish electric drives, the drive is still over 
                <a href="https://www.eia.gov/totalenergy/data/monthly/pdf/sec2.pdf">95%</a> by <a
                    href="https://www.umweltbundesamt.de/daten/verkehr/endenergieverbrauch-energieeffizienz-des-verkehrs#endenergieverbrauch-steigt-seit-2010-wieder-an">oil </a>.
                    Investments in goods traffic by rail were made in favor of the transport
                    Reduced on the street for decades, which was also associated with extensive damage to the area. in the
                    In the context of autonomous driving, tests are now being carried out to determine whether the electrification of motorways can be achieved
                    Overhead lines is possible and useful. However, this does not resolve the basic dilemma of overcrowding
                    Motorways, even if a higher rate of trucking is to be expected from autonomous driving mechanisms.
                    The situation is similar in private transport, which is currently moving away from the
                    Land in the city has increased, because here too many secondary routes have been dismantled or greatly reduced
                    became. In both cases, this was also a question of cost, since public transport is almost always there
                    was and is a subsidy company. These costs will also apply to the expansion of local public transport
                    regularly mentioned as an inhibiting factor. For me the question arises whether we are not the
                    set wrong priorities? Does transport always have to break even or should we transport?
                    rather than viewing it as a methodology used efficiently to move people and goods
                    can? Because, as in many other areas, it is also not taken into account when it comes to transport
                    Follow-up costs for the environment, but also for them through immissions such as noise and emissions such as exhaust gases
                    human health arise. It is important to note again what is happening in the field of green cities
                    The following applies: people want to be mobile and move beyond their place of residence. At their place of residence and
                    But they want to be undisturbed by traffic, especially in city centers, beach areas and on rivers
                    stroll. For this reason, even in cities like Copenhagen, even bicycle traffic is certain
                    Hotspots are reduced and managed efficiently.
    
                    <h3> Approaches </h3>
                    For the movement of goods by rail, for example, it would be necessary to consider the extent to which this can be taken from the
                    Can separate passenger transport? Most goods are in Germany within a few
                    Metropolitan areas produced and consumed. They usually arrive via a few airports and ports, as well
                    across the borders. Analogous to the Swiss model, it would make sense between these nodes
                    To establish railways and to ban freight traffic to the rails there.
                    From distribution centers, the transport could then only take place over the last few kilometers with trucks.
                    Models like those in Amsterdam would also be suitable for private transport. Cheap, close to the city and
                    modern multi-storey car parks, from which you can easily get to the city by public transport or by bike
                    Inner cities can be transported. It is important that this system simply works,
                    E.g. with symbol colors for parking garages and buses and trams that approach them. Also can
                    Here apps help that enable simple billing and provide easily accessible information,
                    as well as enable the use of various modes of transport.
                    Of course, delivery traffic must continue to be guaranteed. This occurs in many
                    Municipalities anyway already at night and in the morning, so that it usually goes unnoticed by consumers
                    takes place. For bicycle traffic as a green means of transport, it is considered that it is physically from the car
                    must be separated. Accordingly, even bicycle streets will not gain much satisfaction for
                    Generate cyclists. Here it seems much smarter to divide it up. To think about where
                    Parallel streets can only be released for cars or bicycles, with as few barriers as possible
                    in the form of traffic lights and crossings to use and establish a system that covers the entire
                    Looking at the urban area and even including the surrounding area via cross-country cycle paths. For car traffic
                    The question arises as to whether one might not think differently about the car sharing concept. So one could consider whether pro

                By and large, at the present time for road traffic <a

                Fuel cells, on the other hand, are still there
                always very expensive to produce and use either a mixture of hydrogen and oxygen,
                as well as either natural gas or methane as a raw material. Synthetic fuels (or Power-to-X
                (Gas / Liquid / Coal)) have low levels of efficiency and are mostly based on fossil fuels as the raw material
                Energy carriers, but can and can be used in existing gasoline engines without any problems
                use the existing petrol station network. Likewise
                CO <sub> 2 </sub> extracted from combustion processes or the air could be used.
                However, as with CCS, this process is still very expensive, making it an industrial one
                Use currently not profitable. These ambiguities, which are common to all types of drive in the
                So far, private transport has had significantly higher disadvantages than advantages

                to set up more flexible loan systems, which make it easier to get your own when on vacation, for example
                Automobile to forego. At the same time, however, it must also be taken into account that diverse research in
                new battery types and more efficient drive systems are implemented.

            <h2>Can we make local transport even more attractive? </h2>
            <p>
                Local public transport is considered to be one of the core building blocks for a green, ecological and economic
                Future. At the same time, local public transport is chronically inefficient and suffers from parameters
                that cannot really be influenced by anyone. Ideally, it should drive late into the night,
                Cover the wide area, be on time, but not be overcrowded and efficiently structure a fast
                Allow occurrence over the entire area. As a final aspect, it should also be very cheap to use
                be. But where it becomes too deficit, it is discontinued. The often discussed option of a free
                Local transport is inefficient because people naturally have no value in anything that is free
                assign and not estimate. A problem that nature as a whole also has.
                At the same time, there is also a control mechanism via the prices that prevents too many
                People use a system that is already overloaded in many places, which requires extensive investments
                would need to make it sustainable in the context of climate efficiency <br> What possibilities
                exist to improve the system and reduce car traffic in cities? <br> <a 
                    href="https://www.iamsterdam.com/en/plan-your-trip/getting-around/parking/park-and-ride">Amsterdam</a>
                    Alongside Copenhagen, it has long been considered the model city for an efficient transport system. Cars become
                    on a ring around the city and can be parked in inexpensive parking garages. A
                    integrative system with chip cards or working apps, parking garages, local public transport,
                    Timetables, occupancy
                    and would integrate other institutions such as museums, could additionally help the attractiveness of the
                    Local transport too
                    raise.
                    Connected to the car parks in Amsterdam are tram stops that lead to the city center
                    are connected
                    and have a high frequency density.
                    Associated with expensive or non-existent parking spaces in the
                    Downtown results in the synergy effect that it is easier to do without driving a car
                    Frustrate motorists. This is one of the cornerstones of an effective one
                    Local transport system: Hotspots must be accessible quickly and efficiently. Trams offer it
                    for main lines the advantage that they run on their own tracks and less from the ones around them
                    Traffic are influenced and at the same time have higher transport capacities than buses. For that are
                    their own track bed makes them more expensive to develop and less flexible in use. they offer
                    So primarily for highly frequented main routes, but physically separated from all others
                    Road users, including pedestrians, should be separated. This shows the second point: separation
                    of the transport systems. In many cities it can be observed that pedestrians and cyclists are in close proximity
                    of local transport. What may appear aesthetically more attractive has the disadvantage that it increases the risk of accidents
                    increases and the efficiency of public transport is reduced. Fences don't necessarily look
                    nice, but help to direct traffic flows. It is similar with turning lanes. So
                    e.g. a backwater up to the rail interrupts the flow of traffic and causes further delays in the
                    tightly timed timetable. Bus connections suffer from this problem even more. It also shows
                    one of the dilemmas of public transport, reliability. This aspect massively reduces comfort
                    of use. Especially when it is coupled with a poor information policy
                    is where you can't tell when the next bus or train is coming. While the problem
                    the reliability, especially in rush hour traffic, due to the fact that it is usually already at the capacity limit
                    difficult to solve existing systems, the information policy would be through apps and clear messages
                    easier to turn off.
                    <br> A major problem in the local transport systems of many municipalities is commuting via central offices
                    Nodes. This leads to unnecessarily long traffic times. Some municipalities like Frankfurt are trying
                    therefore to build this system via bus connections, but quickly end up again in the situation
                    that these buses are stuck in traffic and are not an alternative. So try here
                    to rely on ring connections that spread out in slices like a spider's web. As the core
                    main traffic axes could function here, from which connections in
                    in concentric circles. For better integration of bicycle traffic should also
                    the take-away capacities are increased. The decision is which means of transport are used
                    should not be made across the board and must be based on the circumstances on site and taking into account
                    future plans are made.
                    <br> S-Bahn or U-Bahn, sometimes also elevated railways, are used to cover longer distances
                    used. All of them can be integral aspects of local transport, but they are also very expensive in
                    implementation and maintenance. One kilometer of new subway to be built costs depending on location and age
                    of the existing system between <a 
                    href="https://www.citylab.com/transportation/2011/11/1-billion-doesnt-buy-much-transit-infrastructure-anymore/456/">approx.
                    30 million and 1 billion euros. </a>
                Depending on the location, however, it is precisely these systems that represent the lifelines of traffic. Underground trains have that
                Another advantage that they do not burden the highly frequented traffic systems and also the
                The noise level is shifted underground. As these two factors in the public more and
                are perceived more as a problem, but these costs are put into perspective again. It is also closed
                observe that in the surrounding area of ​​cities like Frankfurt or Munich the connection to the S-Bahn network is one
                of the most important factors in deciding where to live.
                <h3> Summary </h3>
                <p>
                    Public transport networks are the arteries of urban centers. Without them our megacities would be of
                    today
                    not possible. At the same time, however, they are also fragile, cost-intensive and often only produce
                    indirect income in the form of a gain in quality of life. A lack of comfort is a deterrent
                    or
                    even disillusioning the passengers. The most important principle is therefore a complete one
                    To develop a system that can be flexibly implemented step by step. That
                    Local transport system
                    must be catchy, intuitive, integrative and easy to understand, as well as through an open

            <h2>The future is digital </h2>
            <p>
                While areas such as traffic and energy are in the middle of a transformation phase, this is underway
                in agriculture still ahead. The Internet of Things, digitization, blockchain, automation
                and intelligent sensors are in the starting blocks. But while that is mostly controlled by agribusiness
                Agriculture in the USA is already implementing these impulses,
                their use is hindered, especially in Europe, by poor network coverage in rural areas. this
                For agriculture in this country, this means not only higher costs and effort, but also little
                targeted use of fertilizer, water and energy. This doesn't just mean economic problems,
                but also damage to nature, e.g. through higher nitrogen and pesticide loads in the soil and
                Waters than would be necessary.
                The topic of genetics (see section on genetic editing) is particularly controversial in Germany.
                In this country, a stronger move away from conventional agriculture to organic agriculture is desired.
                Whether this, not least because of the higher space requirements, labor input and the risk of crop failure, but
                will really play the role expected in certain strata is unclear.
                Certain traditional agricultural methods certainly offer options both in nature and in
                can also be used by the population without any great effort being involved. So could between
                and hedges are being built again on the edge of many fields and tall fruit trees are being planted. Both
                disappears noticeably, because this involves additional work for the individual farmer.
                Private initiatives could do this work, however

                Farmers also have the advantage that the erosion of the topsoil is counteracted again. In particular

                reduced use of pesticides.
                A growing problem for farmers is the sealing of the landscape through all kinds of construction work.
                This is not only associated with losses for farmers and nature, but also reduces them
                Performance of the floor, since many of these construction measures on high-performance floors with high
                agricultural yield. As with town planning, rural areas should also be essential
                More attention is paid to using undeveloped areas only in an absolute emergency. Large area
                Parking spaces, new warehouses and supermarkets should only be approved accordingly if
                these are planned to save space. This means underground garages instead of open air parking spaces, as well
                In the case of supermarkets, for example, that they should be located on several floors in the same building. That
                The problem of space for the urgently needed portion of agricultural goods is caused by two more
                Factors still massively increased: the growing consumption of meat and biomass. There is an extension

                    And many countries use water that formed before prehistoric times and in subterranean aquifers
                    was saved. So how do we reduce our water footprint? First and foremost by using the

                    which make them impractical for large-scale use. But sewage treatment plants are expensive (the
                    Expansion stage IV in Germany costs approx. 7 million EUR per sewage treatment plant) and will not work without it
                    secure power supply, which India also noticed a few years ago. So solar systems and
                    Sewage treatment plants at the same time? Yes, but even that is not enough if the local authorities do not agree with the
                    Follow the planning and implementation of water pipes.
                    Wouldn't biogas plants and the use of chemical toilets be at least part of the problem
                    remedy? And what about Germany? So far it has been said for a long time: We are a water-rich country. That
                    True, and it is still likely that groundwater in Germany will remain stable
                    replicates, but the drought between 2018 and 2020 also showed that even we are not here
                    Are immune to water shortages and our forests cannot cope well with water stress.

                    now forgotten. Here the question arises whether this is more efficient within the framework
                    Irrigation methods could not be reactivated? It should also be considered whether
                    certain crops that have a high water requirement are no longer planted.

                    Saprobic index low. And, as in developing countries, the pollution from plastic and

                comes, drinking water from plastic bottles is often taken. So why not make sure that
                a recycling system can also be set up in emerging and developing countries? Here you could
                even open up additional sources of income for the poorest sections of the population. And where should you
                start with that? In this case actually with the corporations: who produces plastic or in them

                    wipe out some of the most popular fruits like lemons, oranges and bananas. Genetic engineering and
                    especially gene editing (i.e. changing the genome of plant species without foreign genes)
                    could provide solutions in these cases that can no longer be found through natural breeding

                    Approval is rightly still controversial due to the increased risk of cancer, are with plants
                    Mutations are much less likely. However, one should take into account that gene editing is still a very
                    is a young field of research and, accordingly, tests for long-term effects have rarely been carried out.
                    It is correspondingly difficult to weigh up risks <sup> <a 
                        href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6413072/"> 1</a></sup><sup>,</sup><sup><a

                        It would therefore be advisable to carry out field tests first with <a 
                    href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpls.2018.01732/full"> Tree species </a> and plants

                    Have biodiversity or food security.
                    However, this approach is often contrary to the interests of companies aiming for profit
                    from already high performing crops like wheat. Here are just those of these
                    Companies also want adjustments due to drought or salt resistance through gene editing
                    their complexity cannot be implemented, which even <a

                    Vor dem Hintergrund von Waldsterben und Klimawandel ist auch die natürliche Selektion wieder in den
                    Fokus von Wissenschaftlern geraten. Denn bei jeder Art gibt es auch unterschiedliche Phänotypen, die
                    sich u.a. auch durch divergierende <a

                    to make noticable.
                    So it should be considered whether it is better to work in forests, but also near street trees, not even with
                    Planting individuals of trees with different phenotypes planted together after 30-40 years
                    then to be able to determine the more competitive in the respective situation.

            <h2>Companies</h2>
            <p>
                In a globalized world, networking is the key currency. Globalized production and
                Supply chains, globalized transport, data exchange, servers that host our knowledge. But also
                Friendships across continents. All of this makes our modern life possible. And of course it has
                there also side effects.
                Analyzing and assessing these has been an increasingly important trend in business since 2004.
                With the help of ESG, investments in companies or stock portfolios are classified according to social and
                environmentally relevant criteria such as gender equality or sustainability risks. This
                Step is important and right to have a tool with that
                not just individual companies, but even entire production chains with suppliers across different ones
                Can be assessed for their sustainable production methods across countries. This can not only
                Production methods compared, but also investments depending on environmental and social aspects
                be made.
                However, the question arises whether companies often not only certify practices that they are based on
                would have implemented economic and image reasons anyway? Here I am divided in my assessment.
                On the one hand, organizations like the Global Reporting Initiative <a 
                    href="https://www.globalreporting.org/information/about-gri/Pages/default.aspx">GRI </a> included
                    Establish sustainability standards and collect and share knowledge.
                    On the other hand, evaluations with regard to sustainable business are still negative 
                Rating versehen (e.g. through the  <a href="https://www.unpri.org/download?ac=2968">PRI </a> portrayed for
                a Chilean mining company, which due to legal regulations
                Must use seawater desalination plants to save fresh water). There is no question about that
                this could of course reduce the return on investment for companies.
                At the same time, however, the question is raised how we do it in a capitalist economic system
                prevent sustainable measures from having a negative impact on the return assessment?
                Here one should consider whether it should not apply to all (!) Economic goods that are produced in the world
                can a global and transparent production chain be represented at least digitally?
                The approach established by the ESG shows that this would be possible in principle.
                This does not mean that, in principle, all decisions that a company makes are sustainable
                have to. Instead, there would often be more benefits if companies like <a 
                    href="https://www.tagesspiegel.de/wirtschaft/kohlebergwerk-in-australien-wieso-der-siemens-adani-deal-so-umstritten-ist/25426538.html">Siemens </a>
                    on the one hand, their technology also allows them to be used for the extraction of raw materials, but on the other hand, for this purpose
                    committed to developing technologies and implementing measures that result from these actions
                    emerging
                    Follow-up costs reduced again. Trading with <a 
                    href="https://www.bmu.de/themen/klima-energie/emissionshandel/emissionshandel-was-ist-das/">Emissions </a>
                    was a first step for this, but it was far too short-sighted and would have been implemented much more stringently
                    Need to become. However, there is no point in setting rigid quotas that the state of the art does not
                    gives away. It is better and more sensible for companies not only in the construction sector, but in all of them
                    To oblige environmentally harmful areas to implement compensatory measures and their implementation
                    to accompany permanently.
