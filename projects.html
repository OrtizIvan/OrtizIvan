                <p>There have been at least 5 mass extinction events in the past 500 million years. In the
                    Science, it is now considered a consensus that we are in a sixth. None of them
                    but has led to nature itself becoming extinct. Against the backdrop of natural
                    Development, it is completely irrelevant whether humans continue to exist on earth or
                    not.
                    <br> When we discuss environmental problems, we therefore always discuss from one point of view
                    anthropocentric point of view. We often try to create an ideal image of the world
                    preserve,
                    which is unreachable. Nature itself exists without an agenda or goal.
                    <br> This should be kept in mind when considering the overall very successful history of the
                    Conservation movement considered. However, not least because of the different
                    Interest situations, in the meantime disruptions have arisen, which lead to the fact that the matter is no longer relevant
                    Will is discussed, but with the sole aim of being right. <br>
                    The goal of the environmental movement was and is to develop socially acceptable solutions that
                    Accept nature as the center of life and at the same time also accept people's wishes
                    to be considered according to development and happiness.
                    It must be taken into account that these discussions cannot be conducted morally. Because
                    neither is nature moral, nor do two people, let alone two societies have the
                    same morals. Even the connection to nature is between different individuals
                    and societies differently pronounced. Due to the ever stronger link between
                    Psychology and neurology, however, have been able to provide ever stronger evidence for this in the last few decades
                    it is found that certain ways of thinking and behaving are inherent in all people.
                    Understanding these and applying them to environmental protection issues is the central task of
                    Environmental protection movement in the next few decades. If we succeed in this, we should also manage our acute ones
                    get current problems under control.
                    At this point it should not be a question of all the environmental problems raised down to the deepest
                    Analyze depths of Moria. Instead, I would like to give you the opportunity to get one
                    to give a somewhat distant overview.

                <p>A short disclaimer: I am neither a trained psychologist, nor a behavioral biologist, nor a neurologist
                    Behavioral economist. However, out of personal interest, I regularly read publications on research
                    from these areas.
                    Perhaps that is precisely why I notice that there is a connection between the above-mentioned science segments
                    hardly exists with other scientific fields. As part of the research field  <a
                        href="https://www.isoe.de/forschung/forschungsprogramm/">"Social ecology "</a>
                        an attempt is at least made to integrate the areas of social and natural sciences more closely
                        to be able to use generated knowledge more skillfully. 
                    <br>In my opinion, however, this approach still falls short of the mark. Psychologists
                    and behavioral economists like  <a
                        href="https://www.blueprints.de/lernen-wissen/daniel-kahneman-schnelles-langsames-denken.html">Amos
                        Tversky und Daniel Kahneman</a> oder <a href="https://stevenpinker.com/">Steven Pinker</a> to have
                        along with neurologists like  <a
                        href="https://www.spektrum.de/rezension/buchkritik-zu-gewalt-und-mitgefuehl/1534881">Robert
                        Sapolsky</a> convincing theories of human behavior in the last few decades
                        developed.
                        In doing so, they were not only able to show that our actual behavior is often not in the
                        Is consistent with our own assessment, but also explain the why. During this
                        Results in the field of business are already widely used, e.g. to make purchase decisions
                        or to determine risk behavior, the transfer to the environmental sector is virtually non-existent.
                        From my point of view, this is a failure that leads to funding being inefficient
                        and measures are implemented haphazardly. However, one should keep in mind that the
                        The scientific field is by no means closed off to economic theory approaches. The ones from the
                        Economics and the insurance industry known risk assessments (Risk

                        Assessment basis in order to be able to estimate the success with which environmental measures are implemented.
                        For more than 10 years there have also been calculations based on which one was calculated

                        Be able to enforce the assessment basis for policy makers.
                        As a little food for thought that is not based on empirical research data (and therefore not
                        is scientifically founded) I would like to show which of them are based on a few exemplary approaches
                        Consequences of irrational behaviors such as "Loss Aversion", "Tribal Thinking",
                        "Sunk Cost Fallacy", "Cause and Effect Duration" or our "lazy" brain in the field of sustainable
                        Development.
